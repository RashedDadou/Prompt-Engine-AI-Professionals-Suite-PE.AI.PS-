Prompt Engine AI Professional Toolkit (PE.AI.PS):

An intelligent desktop application for designing futuristic spacecraft using the Grok Imagine API, featuring Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLHF), pre-built templates, and impressive backup graphics. Stellar Designer Pro Description: A fun and powerful Python application that lets you create stunning designs for spacecraft and various other engineering designs using Grok's advanced image generation model (Aurora). The application goes beyond simple guidance, automatically refining your descriptions with intelligent details (engine thrust, armor materials, lighting, etc.).

The application learns from your feedback (RLHF) to improve future designs, prioritizing your preferred engine angles, thrust levels, and artistic styles over time.

It includes pre-built templates (Cyberpunk, Retro Sci-Fi, NASA Realistic, Cinematic Epic).

It saves your favorite designs in a dedicated folder and database.

It features a great dedicated backup graphics engine for offline use or during testing.

Perfect for sci-fi fans, designers, writers, or anyone who dreams of exploring the stars! Screenshots - Main Interface
