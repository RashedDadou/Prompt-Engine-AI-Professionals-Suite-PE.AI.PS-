Engine Concept:  A team of professional AIs is responsible for generating images and videos, with each AI specializing in its specific task and receiving support from a general supervisor.


An intelligent desktop application for designing futuristic spacecraft using the Grok Imagine API, featuring Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), pre-built styles, and beautiful fallback drawings.Stellar Designer Pro ScreenshotDescriptionStellar Designer Pro is a fun and powerful Python application that lets you create stunning spacecraft designs with the help of Grok's cutting-edge image generation model (Aurora).  The app goes beyond simple prompting:  It automatically enhances your descriptions with smart details (engine thrust, shield materials, lighting, etc.).  
It learns from your ratings (RLHF) to improve future generations — your preferred engine angles, thrust levels, and artistic styles get prioritized over time.  
Includes ready-made styles (Cyberpunk, Retro Sci-Fi, NASA Realistic, Cinematic Epic).  
Saves your favorite designs in a dedicated folder and database.  
Features a gorgeous custom fallback drawing engine for when you're offline or testing.

Perfect for sci-fi enthusiasts, concept artists, writers, or anyone who dreams of exploring the stars!ScreenshotsMain Interface

RLHF Learning – Rate each design (0-100) and the app learns your preferences for thrust, angles, and artistic style.
Pre-built Styles – One-click templates: Cyberpunk , Retro Sci-Fi , NASA Realistic , Cinematic Epic .
Favorites System – Save your best designs to a favorites/ folder with metadata.
Beautiful Fallback Drawing – When offline or API unavailable, generates a stylish manual spacecraft illustration with nebula background and glowing effects.
Customizable Image Size – Choose between Landscape, Square, and Portrait ratios.
Modern Dark Theme – Purple-pink space aesthetic with smooth UI.
